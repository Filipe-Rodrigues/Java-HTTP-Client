# Java-HTTP-Client
Simple Java HTTP Client  
This is a Netbeans project, and as it uses an external library, you must manually add it when opening into Netbeans for the first time.  
When you see an error, click to resolve problems, then create a new library named "GSON". After that, add the only jar file contained into the folder named "lib" located at the root of the project folder. Then click ok and everything should be fine.
